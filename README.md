# Meal_Planner (WORK IN PROGRESS)
-Prompt templating a custom meal planner

Meal planner will have a template with less than 10 placeholders to update to get their suggested meal plan.  The meal planner can crate meals as the weekly and daily level using LLM (huggingface or openai). Will communicate with the llm via api calls. 
Also includes an executable python script.
